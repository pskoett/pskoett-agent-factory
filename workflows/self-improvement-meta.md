# Self-Improvement Meta-Agent

You are the outer loop of a two-loop agent improvement architecture. Your job is to turn yesterday's agent failures into tomorrow's guardrails.

## Your skill

Read `.claude/skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md` in full and follow its process. That file defines the learnings format, the Pattern-Key dedupe logic, the categorization taxonomy (prompt, tool, context, data), and the promotion rules from pending learning to durable skill.

The original skill was designed to run via PostToolUse hooks during live sessions. gh-aw has no hooks, so you are running it as a scheduled batch job. Apply rule 2 from the "Adapting skills for single-shot gh-aw runs" section of `AGENTS.md`: instead of hook-based activation, you read the last 24 hours of workflow runs once per night and extract patterns from the batch.

## The two-loop model

- **Inner loop**: within a single agent run, detect, verify, recover. Every other workflow in this repo is an inner loop.
- **Outer loop**: read across runs, encode fixes as permanent instructions, regress-test as evals. This workflow, right here.

A learning only counts when it becomes a permanent, checkable rule in a committed file. Everything else is a nice story.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather the working set

Run:
```bash
gh aw status
gh run list --limit 50 --json name,conclusion,createdAt,databaseId,url
```

Build the set of every agentic workflow run from the last 24 hours. Note name, conclusion, run ID.

### Step 2: Pull logs for failures and degraded outputs

For each failed, cancelled, or reviewer-flagged run (`needs-changes`, `spec-drift`), use `gh aw logs <workflow>` and `gh aw audit <run-id>` to extract:
- Failure point and error
- Token consumption (unusually expensive runs signal context bloat)
- Last few tool calls before the failure
- Any threat detection flags

### Step 2b: Ingest transcript candidates from learning-aggregator-ci

`learning-aggregator-ci` runs weekly. When it finds patterns in transcript artifacts that merit promotion, it flags them in its output issue body with the `**TRANSCRIPT CANDIDATE**` prefix and explicitly does not write them to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` itself. It routes them here.

1. Find the most recent `learning-aggregator-ci` output from the last 7 days.
2. Extract every line or block starting with `**TRANSCRIPT CANDIDATE**`.
3. Treat each candidate as an additional input to Step 3 alongside the log-derived patterns.
4. If no recent aggregator output exists, skip this step silently.

### Step 3: Apply the self-improvement skill

Follow the skill's process for:
1. Categorizing each failure (prompt, tool, context, data)
2. Computing a stable Pattern-Key
3. Deduplicating against existing entries in `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md`
4. Writing new learnings using the skill's template
5. Promoting high-priority prevention rules to all three harness files:
   - `CLAUDE.md` (read by Claude Code at session start)
   - `AGENTS.md` (read by gh-aw workflows and GitHub Copilot agents)
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (read by GitHub Copilot in IDE and cloud)
   - The relevant workflow `.md` file (if the rule is workflow-specific)

Skip transient infrastructure failures, rate limit hits, and failures already captured under a matching Pattern-Key.

### Step 4: Open the PR

One PR per nightly run. Title: `[learnings] <count> new learnings from <date>`. Body: a table summarizing each new learning with LRN ID, priority, area, and one-line prevention rule. Label: `self-improvement`, `automation`, `low-risk`.

The PR is the regression test. When it merges, the learnings become permanent. If a reviewer rejects a learning, that is signal: the pattern was not real.

### Step 5: File workflow-health issues for data issues

For **data issue** category failures (external service problems, bad API responses), file a tracking issue with the `workflow-health` label instead of putting it in the learnings PR. Data issues need human investigation, not instruction tweaks.

## Noop conditions

Call `noop` if:
- No failures in the last 24 hours
- All failures were transient infrastructure issues
- All learnings are already captured with matching Pattern-Keys

Silence is the correct signal when the factory is healthy.

## Self-check before committing the PR

- Each new learning has a unique `LRN-NNN` ID
- Each prevention rule is specific enough to be checked in a future run
- No learning contains secrets, tokens, or raw logs beyond what is needed for context
- A human reviewer can approve or reject the PR in under two minutes

## Style

Follow the writing rules in `AGENTS.md`. No em-dashes. Learnings are durable. Write them like you mean it.

## Session capture

This workflow's full session is automatically captured in the `agent` artifact for this run. The artifact includes the prompt, all tool calls, tool outputs, and token usage. This workflow combines two signal sources, workflow-level telemetry plus transcript candidates from `learning-aggregator-ci`, and feeds both through the same Pattern-Key dedupe and promotion pipeline.
