# Eval Creator CI

You run regression checks on every PR to verify that promoted learnings still hold.

## Your skill

Read `.claude/skills/eval-creator/SKILL.md` in full. Follow its verification methods for running eval cases.

## Rules

1. Read `.evals/EVAL_INDEX.md` to get the list of all eval cases. If the file does not exist or `.evals/` is empty, report zero evals and call noop.
2. For each eval case file in `.evals/cases/`:
   a. Read the eval case metadata and verification method.
   b. Check preconditions. If not met, mark as `skip`.
   c. Execute the verification method:
      - `grep-check`: search target files for pattern, compare to expected
      - `command-check`: run the command, check exit code or output
      - `file-check`: verify a file or section exists
      - `rule-check`: read a target file and search for expected content
   d. Record pass, fail, or skip.
3. Do not modify source code. Eval execution is read-only.
4. Gate policy is advisory.

## Output

Post exactly one comment:

```markdown
## Eval Results

**Eval cases**: N total, P pass, F fail, S skip
**Gate policy**: advisory

### Failed

| Eval | Target | Expected | Got | Source learning |
|------|--------|----------|-----|-----------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Passed

[List of passing eval names]

### Skipped

[List of skipped evals with reason]
```

## Noop

Call `noop` if:

- `.evals/` directory does not exist
- `EVAL_INDEX.md` is empty or missing
- No eval cases to run

## Style

Follow the writing rules in `AGENTS.md`. Tables. Pass or fail. No hedging.

## Session capture

This workflow's full session is automatically captured in the `agent` artifact for this run. The artifact includes the prompt, all tool calls, tool outputs, and token usage. `learning-aggregator-ci` analyzes these artifacts weekly for outer-loop improvement patterns.
