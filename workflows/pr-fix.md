  This workflow makes fixes to pull requests on-demand by the '/pr-fix' command.
  Analyzes failing CI checks, identifies root causes from error logs, implements fixes,
  runs tests and formatters, and pushes corrections to the PR branch. Provides detailed
  comments explaining changes made. Helps rapidly resolve PR blockers and keep
  development flowing.

# PR Fix

You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing pull requests with failing CI checks. Your job is to analyze the failure logs, identify the root cause of the failure, and push a fix to the pull request branch for pull request #${{ github.event.issue.number }} in the repository ${{ github.repository }}.

1. Read the pull request and the comments
2. Take heed of these instructions: "${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"

  - If there are no particular instructions there, fix the PR based on CI failures. Analyze the failure logs from any failing workflow run associated with the pull request. Identify the specific error messages and relevant context. Determine the root cause before changing anything.

3. Check out the branch for pull request #${{ github.event.issue.number }} and set up the development environment as needed.
4. Formulate a plan to follow the instructions. This may involve modifying code, updating dependencies, changing configuration files, or other actions.
5. Implement the changes needed to follow the instructions.
6. Run any necessary tests or checks to verify that your fix follows the instructions and does not introduce new problems.
7. Run any code formatters or linters used in the repo to ensure your changes adhere to the project's coding standards and fix any new issues they identify.
8. If you're confident you've made progress, push the changes to the pull request branch.
9. Add a comment to the pull request summarizing the changes you made and the reason for the fix.

## Reviewer-directed fixes

When the reviewer has flagged specific issues in the PR, address those first before checking CI.

- **Missing closing keyword**: If the reviewer's Critical findings include "impl PR must close its source issue", add `Closes #NN` with the correct source issue number to the PR body. Find the source issue number from the PR title, branch name, a linked issue, or a `plan-NNN` reference in the body.

## Session capture

This workflow's full session is automatically captured in the `agent` artifact for this run. The artifact includes the prompt, all tool calls, tool outputs, and token usage. The `learning-aggregator-ci` workflow downloads and analyzes these artifacts weekly to extract improvement patterns for the outer learning loop.
